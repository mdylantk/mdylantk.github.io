I am sorry to disappoint but at this time, this site is primarily used for test to assist in designing sites base on [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). I will try to update it about myself, but this is not my primary project.

Random Experiments: 

-[Pyscript Fishing Minigame Test](https://mdylantk.github.io/webpage-test.html): This is a game made with Python that uses pyscript to allow it to work on the web. 
-[JS Fishing Minigame Test](https://mdylantk.github.io/Fishing_Page.html): This is a remake of the above minigame, but in js.
