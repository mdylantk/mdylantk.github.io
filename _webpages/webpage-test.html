Note:<br> 
This is a example of a fishing mini game made in pyscript. It is a concept at the moment and only have basic fishing. <br>
Clicking the window with the fish will spawn the bobber. If the bobber is spawn, clicking will slightly pull it to the bottom
center(aka reeling in). Rapidly clicking will make it move faster. Calm fish will swim to and try to bite the bobber if they are near.
They can be reel in, but at the time only a message about the catch weight will be displayed. <br>
Other Notes and Possible Bugs:<br>
-Diffrent fish are stronger than others. There may be a case that it seems the fish will not be reel in, but that not the case. It will require lot of rapid clicks.<br>
-Sometime the first load wont allow fish to bite. refreshing fix this, but currently I am not sure the cause.<br>
-This project reach the point where it show a somewhat working fishing mini game made in pyscript. This means update may be rare.<br>
