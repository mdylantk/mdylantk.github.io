<div> Note: using layout in a md file will use a declare layout. disabling profile will get wid of the social side bar(and profile). Redirect seems to be the
    director id so "/" will act like the landing page if that md is the only one with it and is expose as a servable file. Also md non-data text is only displayed
    with double bracker enclosing  "content" 
</div>
<section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
