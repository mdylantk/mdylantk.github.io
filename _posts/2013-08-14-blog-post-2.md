Notes on Photos pages
======

A few ways to display an image is by markdown or html. Here are two examples:
* Markdown:
  `![alt-text](/images/Image-000.jpg)`
  This will display ![alt-text](/images/Image-000.jpg)

* HTML:
  `<img src='/images/Image-005.jpg'>`
  This will work(at least with _portfolio), but one can try other html and see if it breaks
  It should display this: <img src='/images/Image-005.jpg'>

* Note about excerpt data tag in _portfolio pages:
  Both seems to work as long as what is write there is inclosed by `"`
